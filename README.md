The project involves two primary research questions using NBA data from 2003 to 2022. The first research question focuses on machine learning, specifically predicting a team's likelihood of making the playoffs based on first-half performance metrics. The second question delves into causal inference, examining whether playing on the home field causally influences the number of points scored by a team. This exploration uses statistical models and neural network analyses to uncover patterns and potential causal links in the data.
